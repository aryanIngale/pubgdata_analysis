# PUBG Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of PUBG match-level data to understand how different in-game performance metrics influence player placement. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from large-scale gameplay data and identify key factors contributing to match outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Player placement in PUBG depends on multiple variables such as combat performance, movement, survival time, and team dynamics. This project analyzes these variables to determine which features have the strongest impact on final match ranking.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the PUBG Finish Placement Prediction dataset.
Due to file size constraints, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

Dataset source:
- PUBG Finish Placement Prediction (Kaggle)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Removed redundant and highly correlated features
- Normalized and filtered relevant numerical columns
- Performed basic feature selection for focused analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following aspects were analyzed:
- Distribution of kills, damage dealt, and distance traveled
- Relationship between combat-related features and final placement
- Impact of movement and survival-based metrics on match outcome
- Comparison of player behavior across different match types

## Key Insights
- Higher damage dealt and kill counts show a strong correlation with better placement.
- Survival time and strategic movement play a significant role, especially in team-based matches.
- Aggressive play alone does not guarantee top placement without effective positioning.
- Players with balanced combat and movement metrics consistently perform better.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights that player success in PUBG is driven by a combination of combat efficiency, positioning, and survival strategy. These findings can be useful for player performance evaluation and predictive modeling of match outcomes.

## Future Scope
- Apply machine learning models to predict final placement
- Perform mode-specific analysis (solo, duo, squad)
- Feature engineering for advanced performance metrics
- Model evaluation using regression and ranking techniques
